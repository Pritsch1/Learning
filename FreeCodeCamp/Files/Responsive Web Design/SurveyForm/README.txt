The requirements to pass this test are all present and commented out. I wen't a bit further and decided to make my own form validation methods and warning messages.
    on the HTML file add the commented requirements on lines [22 and 25(for codepen)], [31 and 34(for GitHub)]
    on the JS file uncomment the second line
